This is both, 
- a sample usage of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) in combination with the awesome [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
- a searchable Git cheatsheet


## Install MkDocs locally

```shell
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
pip install mkdocs-glightbox
```

or 

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run this MkDocs documentation locally

```shell
mkdocs serve
```

## Run everything in Gitpod (Web IDE)

If you don't want to use any tool locally, you can use [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#github.com%252Frainan16%252Fgit-cheat-sheet-mkdocs) 

This will allow you to edit the files on a Web IDE and have a live preview.
